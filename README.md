# ⚡ Dual-Stage Power Supply (DC-DC Buck + LDO)

**Input:** 6–10V DC  
**Output 1:** 4V @ 3.5A (Buck Converter)  
**Output 2:** 2.6V @ 1.7A (LDO Regulator)  
**Design Tool:** KiCad  
**ICs:** TPS56837H (Buck), TPS7A53B (LDO)

## 🧩 Description

This is a compact, efficient two-stage power supply designed for low-noise and high-current applications. It converts a 6–10V DC input into:

- 4V @ 3.5A via DC-DC Buck (TPS56837H)
- 2.6V @ 1.7A via LDO (TPS7A53B)

The design was based on official **Texas Instruments datasheets**, simulation tools, and PCB manufacturer guidelines. Great care was taken in layout, thermal management, and ground isolation.

🛠️ **Matched Design Features:**
- Short loops for high-current paths (Cin → SW → Inductor → Cout)
- Correct placement of decoupling capacitors near IC pins
- AGND and PGND separation via internal planes and via stitching
- Wide copper traces sized according to 3.5A requirement
- Respect of layout zones for analog feedback and control

## ⚠️ Design Challenges & Fixes

### ⚠️ LDO BIAS Pin Not Connected

In the first revision, the **BIAS pin** of the LDO (TPS7A53B) was left floating.  
According to [section 8.3.1.2 of the datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps7a53b.pdf#page=19), this causes the output to **follow the input voltage** instead of regulating — which is exactly what happened.

📌 **Fix:** Connected BIAS to VIN (4 V) and added a 1 µF capacitor to GND, as recommended in the datasheet.

---

### ⚠️ Incorrect EN Pin Logic on Buck Converter

Initially, the **EN pin** of the buck converter was connected to its own output (VOUT), assuming it would enable itself after power-up.  
However, this caused the converter to stay disabled at startup.

📌 **Fix:** Connected EN to VIN through a **resistor divider**, ensuring a valid logic-high signal at startup. This resolved the issue and allowed proper converter initialization.

---

### ⚠️ TI-Provided Footprint Had Pad Issues

The **footprint from TI's UltraLibrarian export** for the TPS7A53B had issues:
- Some **pads were incorrectly shaped or numbered**
- **Routing was blocked** due to KiCad DRC violations

📌 **Fix:** Manually edited the footprint in **KiCad Footprint Editor** to:
- Adjust pad shapes and positions
- Fix pin numbering
- Ensure proper copper connection and DRC clearance

---

These issues were identified during layout review and early testing, and fixed in preparation for the next board revision.
